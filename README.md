# SassyAero

(In progress...)

SassyAero is an open source SASS framework for an object orientated styled CSS. It's designed for quick bootstrapping while also retaining scalability if your project starts to grow!

## How it works?

The magic all happens in the aero.scss file! All you need to do is create an "instance" of the class by running the constructor mixin in your main styles.css file. Then easily set values and perform neat tricks with our vast variety of mixins and functions.

## How is this different from Bootstrap or other frameworks?

Bootstrap and SASS or CSS frameworks are all still amazing choices to use for your projects. However, the inspiration for this project came from my need to retain scalability and simplicity when desiging sites for all my valued clients. My motto always is to ensure that if a client chooses to hire another developer to update or mantain the site, the dev or even the client themselves can easily perform style changes.

## SassyAero?

The project is named after my little 15 pound Shihtzu, Aero. His "sassy" little strut + this project using SASS + some beers = SassyAero!

## I want to help!

That's awesome! I welcome all contributors as this project is and will always remain open source. More information coming soon!
